## Task 1 : Even or Odd Number Checker

### Description
This Python program allows the user to input an integer and determines whether the number is even or odd.

## Steps Taken to Solve Task 1

- **Step 1: Define the Problem**
  The goal is to check if a given number is even or odd based on its divisibility by 2.
  
- **Step 2: Plan the Solution**
  I am using the modulus operator (`%`) to check divisibility by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
  
- **Step 3: Get User Input**
  The program uses the `input()` function to take an integer input from the user.
  
- **Step 4: Perform Calculations**
  Based on the remainder:
  If `num % 2 == 0`, print that the number is even.
  Otherwise, print that the number is odd.
  
- **Step 5: Display Results**
  The final sum is displayed using a print statement.

## How to Run Task
1. Open code in a Python IDE.
2. Run the script and enter number.

## Example Output
```
Enter an integer: 7
7 is an Odd number.
```
```
Enter an integer: 10
10 is an Even number.
```
# Task 2 :Sum of Integers from 1 to 50

## Description
  This Python program calculates and displays the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a loop.

## Steps Taken to Solve Task 2

- **Step 1: Define the Problem**
  The goal is to compute the total sum of numbers between 1 and 50.

- **Step 2: Plan the Solution**
  1. Create a variable `total_sum` to store the sum.
  2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
  3. Add each number to `total_sum`.

- **Step 3: Perform Calculations**
  A `for` loop iterates from 1 to 50, adding each number to `total_sum`.

- **Step 4: Display Results**
  The final sum is displayed using a print statement.

## How to Run Task
1. Open code in a Python IDE.
2. Run the script and see the results.

## Example Output
```
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
